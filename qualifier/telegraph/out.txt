morse code is a character encoding scheme used in telecommunication that encodes text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations called dots and dashes or dits and dahs morse code is named for samuel morse there is no distinction between upper and lower case letters each morse code symbol is formed by a sequence of dots and dashes the dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement in morse code transmission the duration of a dash is three times the duration of a dot each dot or dash within a character is followed by period of signal absence called a space equal to the dot duration your flag is flag start morse code still in use flag end the letters of a word are separated by a space of duration equal to three dots and the words are separated by a space equal to seven dots morse code is usually transmitted by onoff keying of an information carrying medium such as electric current radio waves visible light or sound waves the current or wave is present during time period of the dot or dash and absent during the time between dots and dashes morse code can be memorized and morse code signalling in a form perceptible to the human senses such as sound waves or visible light can be directly interpreted by persons trained in the skill
